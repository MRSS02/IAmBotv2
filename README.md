# IAmBotv2


### My crazy discord bot, version 2.


Spiritual sucessor to [this little guy here](https://github.com/MRSS02/IamBot) (deprecated lol). 
<br />
Well, i say spiritual because it's a brand new bot, made in discord.js v13, from scratch (previous one was using v12).
I might reuse some stuff, but... for the most part, it's a new project. The old one was a mess, after all.

## HOW TO RUN THE BOT:

> Well, you do need environment variables for some of the functionalities, but... 
<br />For the bot to just work, you basically just need a token. 
<br />So, create an application on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
<br />Then, copy its token. Create a .env file in the root folder of the project. 
<br />After that, you run `npm i` in the root directory to install the necessary dependencies, then run `node .` to start the bot. 

This bot's source code is open, however, the application that is used to run this bot is currently private. So, keep that in mind.
